# Computer Vision
Field of artificial intelligence that enbales machines to understand and interpret visual data.

## How Does it Works?
Computer vision applications use input from sensing devices, AI, machine learning, and deep learning to replicate the way the human vision system works. The model trained on massive amounts of visual data. The modal can recognize patterns to determine the content of the image.

## Computer Vision Capabilities
### a. Object Classification
- The system classifies the objects in an image according to a defined category. For example, with object classification, a computer could distinguish people from objects in a photo and determine how many people appear in the photo.

### b. Object Indentification
- The system identifies a particular object in a photo, video, or image. For example, with object identification, the system would be able to not only distinguish people in a photo, but also analyze their appearance to determine the identity or traits of those people.

### c. Object Tracking
- The system analyzes a video to process the location of a moving object over time. For example, with object tracking, a parking lot surveillance camera could identify cars in a parking lot and provide information about the location and movements of those cars over time.
