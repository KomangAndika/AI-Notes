# Fine-Tuning-LLM
Most LLM are created on the basis of general use, while they are powerful, they lack the ability of specific use case or special domain. <br>
By fine-tuning the model you can increase the accuracy and the knowledge base of the model on specific domain <br>
Fine-tuning basically adjusting parameters of the pre-trained LLM to a specific task or domain, fine-tuning addressing the general knowledge of an LLM by allowing the model to learn from domain-specific data to make it more accurate and effective for the intended use case. <br>

## At what point i need fine-tuned LLM
### a. Customization
- Every domain or task hasi its own terminologies, patterns, and contextual nuances. By fine-tuning the LLM, it can understand the task better or the specific knowledge.
- The fine-tuning data can be a legal documents, medical reports, business analytics, or internal comapny data.

### b. Data Compliance
- Many industries like healthcare, finance, and law, strict regulations govern the use and hadling of sensitive information. Organizations can ensure the model follow the data comliance standards by fine-tuning the LLM on proprietary or regulated data.

### c. Limited Labeled Data
- In the real word, large quantities of labeled data for specific task is hard to find or very costly. Fine-tuning allows allows organization to leverage pre-existing labeled data more effectively by adapting a pre-trained LLM to the dataset, maximizing its utility and performance.
